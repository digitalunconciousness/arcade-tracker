## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Check user role in "👥 Users" page
- Operators can only report maintenance issues

**Games not showing revenue:**
- Check if user is operator (they can't see revenue)
- Revenue only visible to managers and admins

**Maintenance requests not visible:**
- Operators can only CREATE requests, not view them
- Managers and admins see all maintenance requests

**Cannot record plays:**
- Only managers and admins can handle money/tokens
- Operators cannot record plays for security

**App won't start:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies if missing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start app
python app.py
```

### Port Issues
**If port 5000 is busy:**
1. Edit `app.py`
2. Change last line: `app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)`
3. Access at http://localhost:5001

### Database Issues
**Reset database (DANGER - loses all data):**
```bash
rm arcade.db
python app.py  # Creates new empty database
```
