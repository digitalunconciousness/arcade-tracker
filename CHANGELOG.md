# Changelog

All notable changes to Cabcrawl (called Arcade Tracker until October 2026) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

The biggest release since 1.0: a new name, a new design, a full inventory system, the GATBOX
link, and two security reviews. Printed QR labels, the database and the GATBOX contract all
carry over: an existing install upgrades with `deploy/deploy.sh`, which backs up the database
and runs the migrations.

### Changed
- **The app is now called Cabcrawl** (it was Arcade Tracker). The header wordmark reads CABCRAWL,
  the browser tab and home-screen icon say Cabcrawl, and so does the footer credit when an arcade
  sets its own name or logo. GATBOX tests the board; Cabcrawl runs the floor. The repository is
  `digitalunconciousness/cabcrawl`.
- Nothing a machine, a label or a server depends on changed: every URL (including `/g/<barcode>`
  on printed QR labels), the GATBOX API contract, the database, role, cookie and environment
  variable names, the systemd unit `arcade-tracker.service` and the server paths keep their
  names. `deploy/RUNBOOK.md` says so.
- **A new design**, phone first, in GATBOX's colours: one stylesheet set and one base template,
  every component on `/styleguide`, no CDN assets and a strict content security policy. Every
  page was rebuilt on it and the old templates were deleted.
- **Plays come first**, token value second, so nobody mistakes token value for revenue. Machines
  are ranked by how often they're played.
- **Production runs on PostgreSQL** under systemd behind a Cloudflare tunnel, deployed by
  `deploy/deploy.sh`, which backs up the database before every deploy.
- The README is rewritten, the user guide is the wiki (its source is `docs/wiki/`), and the old
  root documents and scripts moved to `docs/history/`.

### Added
- **Machines**: a page per cabinet with three big buttons (record plays, report problem, log
  work), how it was fixed last time, and every location and status change with dates. Camera
  scanning on the Scan page. Whole-floor label sheets.
- **Coin-door reports**: a label inside the coin door lets anyone report a problem without
  signing in.
- **Collection round**: walk the floor and read every meter, with odd readings flagged on the
  spot.
- **Rotation planner**: ranks floor games by plays per working day, leaves out days a game was
  down, and suggests swaps with the warehouse.
- **Maintenance tasks** that open work orders when they come due, reserving the parts they need.
- **Inventory**:
  - places (rooms, shelves, drawers) and how many of each part are in each;
  - labels for places and parts, and count mode;
  - full and cycle counts, reviewed by a manager;
  - part categories, suppliers and price history;
  - a shopping list, and purchase orders;
  - serial-numbered units;
  - parts reserved for work orders.
- **GATBOX**: each device has its own token and can be limited to some machines. Rail sessions
  are stored and drawn against their window, and a reading can be attached to a work order.
- **Alerts** to ntfy and Discord: coin-door reports, machines down, rails out of window, low
  stock, maintenance due, collection-round flags, part requests, and a daily summary. They're
  held outside opening hours.
- **Branding**: the arcade's own name, logo and sign-in background.
- **The AGPL-3.0**, with a link to the source in every page's footer.
- **Docker**: `docker-compose.yml` runs Cabcrawl with PostgreSQL 17 and an alerts container.
  The image runs as a non-root user with waitress, creates the database on first start and
  migrates it on later ones.

### Security
- CSRF on every form. A strict content security policy. Secure cookies through the tunnel. Login
  rate limits by the visitor's real address. One-time passwords for new and reset accounts.
- Two full security reviews (`docs/FEATURES.md`, F-43 and F-44). Every finding is fixed, each
  with a test.

### Fixed
- Dozens of long-standing bugs, each recorded in `docs/FEATURES.md` with its F-number and
  fixed with a test. Among them:
  - deleting a game or a part left orphaned rows;
  - "Received" requests could add stock twice;
  - photo cleanup deleted live photos;
  - the first-run setup page returned an error;
  - forms were refused through the tunnel.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- A major refactor for readability: the `app/` package (an application factory with routes,
  models and forms) beside the old `app.py`, every dependency updated, and the Raspberry Pi
  hardware packages for skeeball added.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed
- Tab buttons work again.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-13
