"""Start the tracker fresh: delete the history, keep the machines.

Deleted:
  - work orders, their work logs, their parts used and their rail-session tags
  - play records (coin-meter readings), and each machine's play, revenue and ranking totals
  - the whole inventory: parts, stock history, low-stock alerts, part requests and their
    history, stock in each place, supplier links and price history, purchase orders, serial
    units and their history, stock counts, reservations, and the parts on maintenance tasks
  - the work-order photo files in static/maintenance_photos/

Kept:
  - machines: name, barcode (printed QR labels), coin-door code (printed coin-door labels),
    location, status, counter status, price per play, notes, cabinet photo
  - user accounts, GATBOX device tokens, and the rail voltage history (sessions, readings)
  - each machine's location and status timeline (no longer linked to the deleted work orders)
  - storage places, part categories, suppliers, and maintenance tasks

Run it from the repository root with the application's environment loaded, so DATABASE_URL
points at the real database. Without --yes it only counts what it would delete:

    set -a && . ./.env && set +a
    /opt/arcade-tracker-venv/bin/python scripts/reset_history.py

To delete, first take a backup, then pass it in. The script checks the file is a fresh,
non-trivial dump before it touches anything:

    pg_dump --clean --if-exists --no-owner --no-privileges "$DATABASE_URL" \\
        | gzip -9 > /var/backups/arcade-tracker/pre-reset.sql.gz
    /opt/arcade-tracker-venv/bin/python scripts/reset_history.py \\
        --yes --backup /var/backups/arcade-tracker/pre-reset.sql.gz

The database part is one transaction: it all happens or none of it does. Photo files are
removed only after that commit. To undo, restore the dump the way deploy/RUNBOOK.md says.
