"""Characterization fixtures: a small synthetic arcade, one user per role.

Everything here is invented. Machine names, usernames and parts are synthetic and must stay
that way (the repository is public). No test may read ``instance/arcade.db``: the session
fixture in ``tests/conftest.py`` points DATABASE_URL at a scratch file, and the ``sandbox``
fixture below moves every directory a view writes to (photos, uploads, backups, profile
pictures) into a temporary folder, so running the suite leaves the checkout untouched.
