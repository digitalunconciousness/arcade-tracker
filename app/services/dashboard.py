"""The dashboard: what needs attention on the floor today, for whoever is looking.

Each role sees what it acts on first (owner's decision, 2026-10-25, usability round):

* readonly -- what's down, and the floor;
* operator -- open orders (their own first), machines down, maintenance due, low stock;
* manager  -- plays this week against last week, downtime, the rotation planner's swaps,
  low stock;
* admin    -- the manager's view, and alerts that failed to send.

The costlier parts (the rotation plan, downtime from the history) are only worked out for the
roles that see them.
